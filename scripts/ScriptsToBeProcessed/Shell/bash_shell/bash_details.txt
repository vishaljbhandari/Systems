bash - GNU Bourne-Again SHell


Script File BASIC
#! Shebang -> first two characters, then followed by Bash or env

it tells kernel about shell interpreter for your program

#!/usr/bin/bash


make script file executable using chmod u+x    which means for u(user) add x(execute permission)

if current directory is in path variable then you can run the script with only . or with only file name
